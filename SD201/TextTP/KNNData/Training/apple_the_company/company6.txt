Apple celebrates 39th year on April 1
Apple was founded on April 1 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and little-mentioned third partner Ron Wayne, who left the venture 11 days later.
Apple is celebrating its 39th year after the company was founded on April 1 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.
The pair were joined by Ron Wayne, who, according to Wozniak, typed the entirely of the partnership document to the formation of the Apple Computer Company, which is signed by the three men on April 1, "out of his head right in front of us."
Wayne sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 on April 12, and has since described his leaving as the "best decision with the information available to me at the time". Wayne is now best remembered as the designer of Apple's first ever wood cut designed-style logo and author of the Apple 1's manual.
Wozniak has in the past questioned the validity of April 1 as the founding date, claiming the document signed on April 1 represents the partnership formed to produce the PC board for the Apple 1 rather than Apple as a corporation. Generally, April 1 has become the date most closely associated with Apple's foundation in tech folklore.
The company was not formally incorporated until January 3 1977, and was renamed as Apple Inc in January 2007.
