Introduced in 1984, the Macintosh was the first widely sold personal computer with a graphical user interface (GUI). That feature and others -- such as an improved floppy drive design and a low-cost hard drive that made data retrieval faster and more reliable -- helped Apple cultivate a reputation for innovation, which the company still enjoys today. The Apple headquarters are located in Cupertino, CA, at 1-5 Infinite Loop. Apple borrowed the name for the circular road around their office buildings from programming, where an infinite loop is the term for a code sequence lacking a functional exit.
