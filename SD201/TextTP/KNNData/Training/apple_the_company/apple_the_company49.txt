With regard to the annual iPhone update, bear in mind that a great many consumer electronics companies release several different models over the course of a year. Apple concentrates the innovations of their R&D pipeline into single monolithic releases annually, rather than spreading them out over a few models. Is this a better deal for the consumer? I'd venture it is â€“ it means a far simpler purchase experience, at the least, as no one has to compare spec sheets to know what kind of deal they're getting relative to their alternatives in the product line. Anyone who's tried to buy a car GPS knows what kind of misery that can be.
