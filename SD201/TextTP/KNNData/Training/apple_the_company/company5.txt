Apple today announced that its active installed base of devices has reached 1.3 billion, a milestone the company hit in January. That includes iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch models in use around the world. 
The number was shared by Apple CEO Tim Cook in a press release announcing the company's record earnings for the first fiscal quarter of 2018. Cook says that Apple has seen the number of active devices grow 30 percent over the course of the last two years. Apple hit its 1 billion active device milestone back in January of 2016.
"We've also achieved a significant milestone with our active installed base of devices reaching 1.3 billion in January. That's an increase of 30 percent in just two years, which is a testament to the popularity of our products and the loyalty and satisfaction of our customers."
Apple this afternoon said it sold 77.3 million iPhones, 13.2 million iPads, and 5.1 million Macs during the first quarter of 2018.
