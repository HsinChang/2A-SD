Apple marketing and communications have been a weird beast since the return of Steve Jobs. Jobs led the company's secretive big surprise-style announcements, dropping fully-formed, (mostly) ready to buy products suddenly into the world. The attention these announcements commanded grew steadily over the last decade. The mystery around Apple's product development, and the excitement with which new goodies were announced, were enough to capture the imagination of the press, who grew desperate for even the tiniest of Apple rumors. Most other companies announce their stuff well in advance, so there's much less excitement at release.
