Apart from being low in calories, apples are naturally low in fat and have a high water content, which makes them a great option for healthy snacking with your waistline in mind (read: they’re a far better choice than those energy-dense bars and balls you’d find in the snack food aisle).

Apples also have a low glycaemic index. To get you up to speed with what that actually means, here’s a quick science lesson: when you eat carbs, they are broken down into glucose (aka sugar) which enters the bloodstream – the glycaemic index is a measure of how quickly this sugar enters the bloodstream. So, as apples are low GI, their energy is slowly released, which can help to keep you feeling full and satisfied. Capiche?

But, before the fear of that dreaded ‘s’ word sinks in, let me tell you that you don’t have to worry about the natural sugar in apples (FYI, there’s roughly 15 grams). What you should try to minimise is added sugar, i.e. the kind in that packet of M&M’s sitting in your desk drawer.
