From a retail perspective, Apple has made some interesting choices that make it stand out. Every single product in Apple's lineup is available to be touched, used and experimented with, so that prospective customers can quickly size up their options. This is a departure from retail stores with plastic dummy phones and PCs that have been locked down into some sort of demo mode. These outposts also mean that Apple customers have a place to go when things break. The support is also surprisingly accommodating, at least in my experience. It's not clear why these stores bother with policy, as a polite request to bend the rules is generally all that's necessary to get satisfaction. (Sometimes even the request is unnecessary â€“ I was once given a free iPad replacement when I brought in my damaged screen for a repair.)
